/// ERC4626
/// @dev The vault is compliant with ERC-4626 and with ERC-2612 (permit extension). Though the vault has a
/// non-conventional behaviour on max functions: they always return zero.
/// @dev totalSupply is not updated to include shares minted to fee recipients. One can call accrueInterestView to
/// compute the updated totalSupply.
///
/// TOTAL ASSETS
/// @dev Adapters are responsible for reporting to the vault how much their investments are worth at any time, so that
/// the vault can accrue interest or realize losses.
/// @dev _totalAssets stores the last recorded total assets. Use totalAssets() for the updated total assets.
/// @dev Upon interest accrual, the vault loops through adapters' realAssets(). If there are too many adapters and/or
/// they consume too much gas on realAssets(), it could cause issues such as expensive interactions, even DOS.
///
/// LOSS REALIZATION
/// @dev Loss realization occurs in accrueInterest and decreases the total assets, causing shares to lose value.
/// @dev Vault shares should not be loanable to prevent shares shorting on loss realization. Shares can be flashloanable
/// because flashloan-based shorting is prevented as interests and losses are only accounted once per transaction.
///
/// SHARE PRICE
/// @dev The share price can go down if the vault incurs some losses. Users might want to perform slippage checks upon
/// withdraw/redeem via an other contract.
/// @dev Interest/loss are accounted only once per transaction (at the first interaction with the vault).
/// @dev Donations increase the share price but not faster than the maxRate.
/// @dev The vault has 1 virtual asset and a decimal offset of max(0, 18 - assetDecimals). In order to protect against
/// inflation attacks, the vault might need to be seeded with an initial deposit. See
/// https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/erc4626#inflation-attack
/// @dev Donations and forceDeallocate penalties increase the rate, which can attract opportunistic depositors which
/// will dilute interest. This fact can be mitigated by reducing the maxRate.
///
/// CAPS
/// @dev Ids have an asset allocation, and can be absolutely capped and/or relatively capped.
/// @dev The allocation is not always up to date, because interest and losses are accounted only when (de)allocating in
/// the corresponding markets.
/// @dev The caps are checked on allocate (where allocations can increase) for the ids returned by the adapter.
/// @dev Relative caps are "soft" in the sense that they are not checked on exit.
/// @dev Caps can be exceeded because of interest.
/// @dev The relative cap is relative to firstTotalAssets, not realAssets.
/// @dev The relative cap unit is WAD.
/// @dev To track allocations using events, use the Allocate and Deallocate events only.
///
/// FIRST TOTAL ASSETS
/// @dev The variable firstTotalAssets tracks the total assets after the first interest accrual of the transaction.
/// @dev Used to implement a mechanism that prevents bypassing relative caps with flashloans. This mechanism makes the
/// caps conservative and can generate false positives, notably for big deposits that go through the liquidity adapter.
/// @dev Also used to accrue interest only once per transaction (see the "share price" section).
/// @dev Relative caps can still be manipulated by allocators (with short-term deposits), but it requires capital.
/// @dev The behavior of firstTotalAssets is different when the vault has totalAssets=0, but it does not matter
/// internally because in this case there are no investments to cap.
///
/// ADAPTERS
/// @dev Loose specification of adapters:
/// - They must enforce that only the vault can call allocate/deallocate.
/// - They must enter/exit markets only in allocate/deallocate.
/// - They must return the right ids on allocate/deallocate. Returned ids must not repeat.
/// - After a call to deallocate, the vault must have an approval to transfer at least `assets` from the adapter.
/// - They must make it possible to make deallocate possible (for in-kind redemptions).
/// - The totalAssets() calculation ignores markets for which the vault has no allocation.
/// - They must not re-enter (directly or indirectly) the vault. They might not statically prevent it, but the curator
/// must not interact with markets that can re-enter the vault.
/// - After an update, the sum of the changes returned after interactions with a given market must be exactly the
/// current estimated position.
/// @dev Ids being reused are useful to cap multiple investments that have a common property.
/// @dev Allocating is prevented if one of the ids' absolute cap is zero and deallocating is prevented if the id's
/// allocation is zero. This prevents interactions with zero assets with unknown markets. For markets that share all
/// their ids, it will be impossible to "disable" them (preventing any interaction) without disabling the others using
/// the same ids.
/// @dev On allocate or deallocate, the adapters might lose some assets (total realAssets decreases), for instance due
/// to roundings or entry/exit fees. This loss should stay negligible compared to gas. Adapters might not statically
/// ensure this, but the curators should not interact with markets that can create big entry/exit losses.
/// @dev Except particular scenarios, adapters should be removed only if they have no assets. In order to ensure no
/// allocator can allocate some assets in an adapter being removed, there should be an id exclusive to the adapter with
/// its cap set to zero.
///
/// ADAPTER REGISTRY
/// @dev An adapter registry can be added to restrict the adapters. This is useful to commit to using only a certain
/// type of adapters for example.
/// @dev If adapterRegistry is set to address(0), the vault can have any adapters.
/// @dev When an adapterRegistry is set, it retroactively checks already added adapters.
/// @dev If the adapterRegistry now returns false for an already added adapter, it doesn't impact the vault's
/// functioning.
/// @dev The invariant that adapters of the vault are all in the registry holds only if the registry cannot remove
/// adapters (is "add only").
///
/// LIQUIDITY ADAPTER
/// @dev Liquidity is allocated to the liquidityAdapter on deposit/mint, and deallocated from the liquidityAdapter on
/// withdraw/redeem if idle assets don't cover the withdrawal.
/// @dev The liquidity adapter is useful on exit, so that exit liquidity is available in addition to the idle assets. But
/// the same adapter/data is used for both entry and exit to have the property that in the general case looping
/// supply-withdraw or withdraw-supply should not change the allocation.
/// @dev If a cap (absolute or relative) associated with the ids returned by the liquidity adapter on the liquidity data
/// is reached, deposit/mint will revert. In particular, when the vault is empty or almost empty, the relative cap check
/// is likely to make deposits revert.
///
/// TOKEN REQUIREMENTS
/// @dev List of assumptions on the token that guarantees that the vault behaves as expected:
/// - It should be ERC-20 compliant, except that it can omit return values on transfer and transferFrom.
/// - The balance of the vault should only decrease on transfer and transferFrom.
/// - It should not re-enter the vault on transfer or transferFrom.
/// - The balance of the sender (resp. receiver) should decrease (resp. increase) by exactly the given amount on
/// transfer and transferFrom. In particular, tokens with fees on transfer are not supported.
///
/// LIVENESS REQUIREMENTS
/// @dev List of assumptions that guarantees the vault's liveness properties:
/// - Adapters should not revert on realAssets.
/// - The token should not revert on transfer and transferFrom if balances and approvals are right.
/// - The token should not revert on transfer to self.
/// - totalAssets and totalSupply must stay below ~10^35. Initially there are min(1, 10^(18-decimals)) shares per asset.
/// - The vault is pinged at least every 10 years.
/// - Adapters must not revert on deallocate if the underlying markets are liquid.
///
/// TIMELOCKS
/// @dev The timelock duration of decreaseTimelock is the timelock duration of the function whose timelock is being
/// decreased (e.g. the timelock of decreaseTimelock(addAdapter, ...) is timelock[addAdapter]).
/// @dev It is still possible to submit changes of the timelock duration of decreaseTimelock, but it won't have any
/// effect (and trying to execute this change will revert).
/// @dev Multiple clashing data can be pending, for example increaseCap and decreaseCap, which can make so accepted
/// timelocked data can potentially be changed shortly afterwards.
/// @dev If a function is abdicated, it cannot be called no matter its timelock and what executableAt[data] contains.
/// Otherwise, the minimum time in which a function can be called is the following:
/// min(
///     timelock[selector],
///     executableAt[selector::_],
///     executableAt[decreaseTimelock::selector::newTimelock] + newTimelock
/// ).
/// @dev Nothing is checked on the timelocked data, so it could be not executable (function does not exist, argument
/// encoding is wrong, function' conditions are not met, etc.).
///
/// ABDICATION
/// @dev When a timelocked function is abdicated, it can't be called anymore.
/// @dev It is still possible to submit data for it or change its timelock, but it will not be executable / effective.
///
/// GATES
/// @dev Set to 0 to disable a gate.
/// @dev Gates must never revert, nor consume too much gas.
/// @dev receiveSharesGate:
///     - Gates receiving shares.
///     - Can lock users out of getting back their shares deposited on an other contract.
/// @dev sendSharesGate:
///     - Gates sending shares.
///     - Can lock users out of exiting the vault.
/// @dev receiveAssetsGate:
///     - Gates withdrawing assets from the vault.
///     - The vault itself (address(this)) is always allowed to receive assets, regardless of the gate configuration.
///     - Can lock users out of exiting the vault.
/// @dev sendAssetsGate:
///     - Gates depositing assets to the vault.
///     - This gate is not critical (cannot block users' funds), while still being able to gate supplies.
///
/// FEES
/// @dev Fees unit is WAD.
/// @dev This invariant holds for both fees: fee != 0 => recipient != address(0).
///
/// ROLES
/// @dev The owner cannot do actions that can directly hurt depositors. Though it can set the curator and sentinels.
/// @dev The curator cannot do actions that can directly hurt depositors without going through a timelock.
/// @dev Allocators can move funds between markets in the boundaries set by caps without going through timelocks. They
/// can also set the liquidity adapter and data, which can prevent deposits and/or withdrawals (it cannot prevent
/// "in-kind redemptions" with forceDeallocate though). Allocators also set the maxRate.
/// @dev Warning: if setIsAllocator is timelocked, removing an allocator will take time.
/// @dev Roles are not "two-step", so anyone can give a role to anyone, but it does not mean that they will exercise it.
///
/// MISC
/// @dev Zero checks are not systematically performed.
/// @dev No-ops are allowed.
/// @dev NatSpec comments are included only when they bring clarity.
/// @dev The contract uses transient storage.
/// @dev At creation, all settings are set to their default values. Notably, timelocks are zero which is useful to set
/// up the vault quickly. Also, there are no gates so anybody can interact with the vault. To prevent that, the gates
/// configuration can be batched with the vault creation.
